# Evidence and Sanitization

This folder contains sanitized screenshots and exported outputs that support the lab runbooks.

## Rules
- Do not commit passwords, tokens, API keys, or license keys.
- Blur public IP addresses, hostnames if they include personal identifiers, and any email addresses.
- Remove serial numbers and unique IDs when possible.
- Prefer cropped screenshots that show only the relevant UI sections.
